// Legacy notice: Prisma has been retired from this project.
// This file is intentionally left as a placeholder to discourage accidental reintroduction
// of DB dependencies into the static-site generation (SSG) path.
//
// If you decide to add a database in the future (e.g., Supabase/Postgres), do so in a
// separate backend service or API layer that does NOT run during Astro's build step.
// Keep SSG DB-free; use client-side fetches or serverless endpoints for dynamic data.

// No schema here by design.
